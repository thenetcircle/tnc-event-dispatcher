# TNC EventDispatcher

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/thenetcircle/tnc-event-dispatcher.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/thenetcircle/tnc-event-dispatcher)

TNC EventDispatcher is a alternative of [Symfony event-dispatcher](https://symfony.com/doc/current/components/event_dispatcher.html) for supporting asynchronous and unified structured events.  
It works as same as Symfony event-dispatcher, has same interface and a few more options, can replace Symfony evnet-dispatcher seamlessly.
