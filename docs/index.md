# What's TNC EventDispatcher

TNC EventDispatcher is a alternative of [Symfony event-dispatcher](https://symfony.com/doc/current/components/event_dispatcher.html) for supporting asynchronous and unified structured events.
It works as same as Symfony event-dispatcher, has same interface and a few more options, can replace Symfony evnet-dispatcher seamlessly.
